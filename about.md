title: About Me  
---

Any opportunity for someone to creatively explore new ideas interests me greatly.

<p>

A gamer, hobbyist writer, and aspiring programmer, I like to explore new ideas.

<p>

As far as languages go, I have experience working with Java, Python, LSL, and Twine as programming and scripting languages.

<p>

In terms of software, I have experience with Eclipse, Visual Basic, IDLE, Github and Auto Hotkey.

<p>

I have basic knowledge in a few different things. I'd love to learn more about HTML, CSS, Javascript and more.

<p>

Feel free to contact me if you have an opportunity for me!
